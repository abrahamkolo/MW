# MW-Omega System Overview

Document Control: MW-DOC-ARCH-001-v1.0

## Layer Architecture

MW-Omega is a 5-layer operating system. Each layer governs the layer below it. No layer operates independently.

### Layer 0 -- Identity

The foundational layer. All decisions, creations, and systems originate from identity clarity.

- **Flame Spiral Method (TM)**: 24-step circular progression system
- **ABJ Profile v-infinity**: Integrity-anchored strategic builder operating mode
- **Formation Doctrine**: Identity precedes output. Who you are determines what you build.

### Layer 1 -- Governance

The constraint layer. Every decision passes through five filters before execution.

| Filter | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Robustness | Does this survive volatility? |
| Asymmetry | Is the upside disproportionate to the downside? |
| Inevitability | Does this become more likely to succeed over time? |
| Sovereignty | Does this increase or decrease my independence? |
| Wealth | Does this build durable, transferable value? |

### Layer 2 -- Execution

The 17-power system. Decisions become shipped artifacts through specialized skill modules.

See README.md for the complete power-to-skill mapping.

### Layer 3 -- Infrastructure

Artifacts become institutional assets through legal protection, financial modeling, and entity operations.

- IP Asset Registry (ip-asset-tracker)
- Capital Architecture (capital-architecture-modeler)
- Entity Legal Operations (entity-legal-operations)

### Layer 4 -- Legacy

Assets become founder-irrelevant institutions through facilitator training, institutional deployment, and cultural authority building.

- Facilitator Training System (facilitator-training-system)
- Stack Deployment Engine (stack-deployment-engine)
- Institutional Perfection Engine (institutional-perfection-engine)

## Energy Protocol

MW-Omega respects Human Design Projector energy constraints:

- **Maximum**: 20 hours/week of active execution
- **Cadence**: Bi-weekly income structure
- **Throttle**: Energy state governs output volume, not quality
- **Recovery**: Silence is infrastructure, not avoidance
